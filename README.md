# 100DaysOfJavaScript
I was very excited when I started this project and I found a list of 100 project names in this list. I started these projects quickly and from time to time I realized that some projects were duplicates of each other and I combined some of them to prevent this repetition and reduced the number of projects to 50. There were also some that I eliminated.
